> [!WARNING]
> **Trust is release-specific.** Before installing, read the notes attached to

## Why FyAgent?

Modern AI-powered coding relies on tools like Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes — but each has its own configuration format. Switching API providers means manually editing JSON, TOML, or `.env` files, and there is no unified way to manage MCP and Skills across multiple tools.

**FyAgent** gives you a single desktop app to manage all supported AI tools. Instead of editing config files by hand, you get a visual interface to import providers with one click, switch between them instantly, with 50+ built-in provider presets, unified MCP and Skills management, and system tray quick switching — all backed by a reliable SQLite database with atomic writes that protect your configs from corruption.

- **One App, Eight Tools** — Manage Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes from a single interface
- **No More Manual Editing** — 50+ provider presets including AWS Bedrock, NVIDIA NIM, and community relays; just pick and switch
- **Unified MCP & Skills Management** — One panel to manage MCP servers and Skills across Claude, Codex, Gemini, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Hermes with bidirectional sync
- **System Tray Quick Switch** — Switch providers instantly from the tray menu, no need to open the full app
- **Cloud Sync** — Sync provider data across devices via Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, or WebDAV servers
- **Cross-Platform** — Native desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux, built with Tauri 2
- **Built-in Utilities** — Includes utilities for first-launch login confirmation, environment diagnostics, plugin extension sync, and more

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Which AI tools does FyAgent support?</strong></summary>

FyAgent supports eight tools: **Claude Code**, **Claude Desktop**, **Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, **Grok Build**, **OpenCode**, **OpenClaw**, and **Hermes**. Each tool has dedicated provider presets and configuration management.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to restart the terminal after switching providers?</strong></summary>

For most tools, yes — restart your terminal or the CLI tool for changes to take effect. The exception is **Claude Code**, which currently supports hot-switching of provider data without a restart.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My plugin configuration disappeared after switching providers — what happened?</strong></summary>

FyAgent provides a "Shared Config Snippet" feature to pass common data (beyond API keys and endpoints) between providers. Go to "Edit Provider" → "Shared Config Panel" → click "Extract from Current Provider" to save all common data. When creating a new provider, check "Write Shared Config" (enabled by default) to include plugin data in the new provider. All your configuration items are preserved in the default provider imported when you first launched the app.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS installation</strong></summary>

The complete macOS app is ad-hoc signed with no certificate identity. It is
not signed with an Apple Developer ID and is not notarized; the DMG container
is unsigned. Ad-hoc signing does not establish Apple trust, so macOS may block
the first launch. After attempting to open FyAgent once, use Apple's supported
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** flow and confirm the
prompt. Verify the exact Release Notes and evidence first; do not disable
Gatekeeper or remove quarantine metadata.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why can't I delete the currently active provider?</strong></summary>

FyAgent follows a "minimal intrusion" design principle — even if you uninstall the app, your CLI tools will continue to work normally. The system always keeps one active configuration, because deleting all configurations would make the corresponding CLI tool unusable. If you rarely use a specific CLI tool, you can hide it in Settings. To switch back to official login, see the next question.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I switch back to official login?</strong></summary>

Add an official provider from the preset list. After switching to it, run the Log out / Log in flow, and then you can freely switch between the official provider and third-party providers. Codex supports switching between different official providers, making it easy to switch between multiple Plus or Team accounts.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong></summary>

- **Database**: `~/.fyagent/fyagent.db` (SQLite — providers, MCP, prompts, skills)
- **Local settings**: `~/.fyagent/settings.json` (device-level UI preferences)
- **Backups**: `~/.fyagent/backups/` (auto-rotated, keeps 10 most recent)
- **Skills**: `~/.fyagent/skills/` (symlinked to corresponding apps by default)
- **Skill Backups**: `~/.fyagent/skill-backups/` (created automatically before uninstall, keeps 20 most recent)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux (Wayland + NVIDIA): clicks don't register and the window black-screens on resize</strong></summary>

The AppImage forces `GDK_BACKEND=x11` (XWayland) to avoid a historical native-Wayland crash. On newer Wayland + NVIDIA setups this can leave the web content area unclickable (the title-bar buttons still work) and black-screen on resize. Launch with the opt-in escape hatch to switch back to native Wayland:

```bash
FYAGENT_GDK_BACKEND=wayland ./FyAgent-*.AppImage
```

If you launch from a desktop icon, add it to the `.desktop` `Exec=` line (e.g. `env FYAGENT_GDK_BACKEND=wayland /path/to/AppImage`) or set it in your session environment. The variable is generic: on tiling Wayland compositors (sway/Hyprland) where clicks don't register, try `FYAGENT_GDK_BACKEND=x11` instead. Leaving it unset keeps the default behavior.

</details>

## Documentation

For detailed guides on every feature, check out the **[User Manual](docs/user-manual/en/README.md)** — covering provider management, MCP/Prompts/Skills, proxy & failover, and more.

Contributors should start with the responsibility-based
**[current development documentation](docs/fyagent/development/README.md)** and
follow its links to the owning active specs.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. **Add Provider**: Click "Add Provider" → Choose a preset or create custom configuration
2. **Switch Provider**:
   - Main UI: Select provider → Click "Enable"
   - System Tray: Click provider name directly (instant effect)
3. **Takes Effect**: Restart your terminal or the corresponding CLI tool to apply changes (Claude Code does not require a restart)
4. **Back to Official**: Add an "Official Login" preset, restart the CLI tool, then follow its login/OAuth flow

### MCP, Prompts, Skills & Sessions

- **MCP**: Click the "MCP" button → Add servers via templates or custom config → Toggle per-app sync
- **Prompts**: Click "Prompts" → Create presets with Markdown editor → Activate to sync to live files
- **Skills**: Click "Skills" → Browse GitHub repos → One-click install to supported apps
- **Sessions**: Click "Sessions" → Browse, search, and restore conversation history across supported session sources

> **Note**: On first launch, you can manually import existing CLI tool configs as the default provider.

## Download & Installation

### System Requirements

- **Windows**: Windows 10 and above
- **macOS**: macOS 12 (Monterey) and above
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 11+ / Fedora 34+ and other mainstream distributions

### Windows Users

Download `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Windows-x64-setup.exe` on x64 or
`FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Windows-arm64-setup.exe` on ARM64 from the
[Releases](https://github.com/fy-agent/fyagent/releases) page, replacing
`X.Y.Z` with the Release version. These are per-machine NSIS setup programs;
FyAgent does not publish an MSI or Windows Portable ZIP.

> **Signing status:** Read the Release's Windows signing table and
> `signing-status.json`. If an installer is `NotSigned`, Windows SmartScreen may
> warn. Confirm the exact asset name, digest, source SHA, and attestation before
> continuing; do not disable SmartScreen or weaken an organization-managed
> security policy.

### macOS Users

Download `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-macOS.dmg` (recommended) or
`FyAgent-X.Y.Z-macOS.zip` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/fy-agent/fyagent/releases) page.

> **Ad-hoc app, unsigned DMG:** The complete app is ad-hoc signed with no
> certificate identity; both the ZIP and DMG contain that same app. It is not
> signed with an Apple Developer ID and is not notarized, while the DMG
> container is unsigned. Ad-hoc signing does not provide Apple trust. After
> attempting to open the app once, use **System Settings → Privacy & Security →
> Open Anyway** and confirm the prompt. Verify the exact Release evidence first;
> do not disable Gatekeeper or strip quarantine metadata.

### Linux Users

Download the matching native Linux build from the
[Releases](https://github.com/fy-agent/fyagent/releases) page:

- x64: `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Linux-x86_64.AppImage`,
  `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Linux-x86_64.deb`, or
  `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Linux-x86_64.rpm`
- ARM64: `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Linux-arm64.AppImage`,
  `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Linux-arm64.deb`, or
  `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Linux-arm64.rpm`

> **Flatpak**: Not included in official releases. You can build it yourself from the `.deb` — see [`flatpak/README.md`](flatpak/README.md) for instructions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Stable Release attachment contract</strong></summary>

The formal Release contains exactly ten installers: the two macOS files, two
Windows NSIS setup EXEs, and six Linux files named above. The ten installers,
`download-manifest.json`, `build-metadata.json`, and `signing-status.json` are
the 13 attestation subjects. `artifact-attestation.sigstore.json` is the
fourteenth and final attachment. The workflow rejects missing, duplicate,
renamed, or extra files; a Release is accepted only after the formal run and an
independent post-publication verification succeed.

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.fyagent/fyagent.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ProxyService**: Local proxy mode with hot-switching and format conversion
- **SessionManager**: Conversation history browsing across supported session sources
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

<summary><strong>Development Guide</strong></summary>

### Environment Requirements

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) 2026.8.0 or newer,
  installed globally
- [Tauri 2.0 system prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

The repository pins Node.js 24.19.0 in `.node-version`, pnpm 10.12.3 in
`package.json`, Rust 1.97.1 in `rust-toolchain.toml`, and Python 3.14.7 in
`.python-version`. `mise.toml` owns the task API and the uv selector;
`mise.lock`, `uv.lock`, and the uv-managed `.venv` lock the approved Python
environment. The Tauri CLI is installed with the project dependencies.

After reviewing the repository config, initialize the development environment:

```bash
mise trust
mise run bootstrap
mise run system:check
mise run dev
```

`mise trust` is an explicit developer security decision and no project task
runs it automatically. `bootstrap` does not install privileged system packages,
change Git remotes, refresh locks, or publish. WSL must not resolve managed
tools from `/mnt/<drive>` or Windows shims. See the generated
[canonical task catalog](docs/fyagent/development/mise-tasks.md) for the full
API.

### Native Platform Builds

Local development and packaging support only the current host operating
system. The standard commands do not accept another OS or architecture target:

```bash
mise run dev
mise run build
```

FyAgent installers are built only by GitHub Actions on native Windows x64 and
ARM64, Linux x64 and ARM64, and macOS runners. The macOS job produces the
Universal build. Local Linux/WSL-to-Windows or macOS packaging is not a
supported release path.

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install locked dependencies and verify the environment
mise run bootstrap

# Dev mode (hot reload)
mise run dev

# Type check
mise run typecheck

# Format code
mise run format

# Check code format
mise run format:check

# Run frontend unit tests
mise run test:unit

# Run tests in watch mode (recommended for development)
mise run test:unit:watch

# Build application
mise run build

# Build debug version
mise run build:debug
```

### Rust Backend Development

```bash
# Format Rust code
mise run rust:fmt

# Run clippy checks
mise run rust:clippy

# Run backend tests
mise run rust:test

# Run specific tests
mise run rust:test test_name

# Run the complete current-host gate before a pull request
mise run check
```

### Testing Guide

**Frontend Testing**:

- Uses **vitest** as test framework
- Uses **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** to mock Tauri API calls
- Uses **@testing-library/react** for component testing

**Running Tests**:

```bash
# Run all tests
mise run test:unit

# Watch mode (auto re-run)
mise run test:unit:watch

# Complete frontend gate
mise run check:frontend
```

### Tech Stack

**Frontend**: React 18 · TypeScript · Vite · TailwindCSS 3.4 · TanStack Query v5 · react-i18next · react-hook-form · zod · shadcn/ui · @dnd-kit

**Backend**: Tauri 2.8 · Rust · serde · tokio · thiserror · tauri-plugin-process/dialog/store/log
