# Hook Guidelines

These conventions apply to leftover `src/hooks/` and feature-local hooks
outside `src/v2`. V2 feature data crosses `FeaturePorts` and V2 query hooks
under `src/v2/shared/features/`; pages must not import leftover hooks. See
[V2 Shell](./v2-shell.md) and [Frontend Reuse](./reuse.md). Reuse is the
default: if a new hook will be used by another module, put it in
`src/v2/shared/features/` (or leftover `src/hooks/` for leftover-only
surfaces) on the first commit.

## Location and Naming

Custom hooks are exported functions whose names start with `use`. Cross-feature
generic hooks normally live in `src/hooks/`; a hook that belongs to a cohesive
policy/module may remain beside that module, such as
`src/lib/layout/useWindowLayoutMode.ts`. Hooks private to a feature may be
co-located beneath that feature and re-exported from a local barrel. Do not move
a feature-private hook to `src/hooks/` unless a second feature needs it, or a
sibling leftover feature is expected to need it next. In that second case, place
it in `src/hooks/` on the first commit rather than copying it later.

```tsx
// src/hooks/useDebouncedValue.ts
export function useDebouncedValue<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState<T>(value);
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setDebouncedValue(value), delay);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [value, delay]);
  return debouncedValue;
}
```

`src/components/providers/forms/hooks/index.ts` is the local barrel for the
provider-form hooks. `src/components/mcp/useMcpValidation.ts` is another
feature-local hook that stays beside its MCP UI.

## Effects and Native Events

Hooks that create timers, observers, or native listeners return the cleanup
from their effect. The Tauri event wrapper also guards an asynchronously
created unsubscribe function so it is released even when unmount happens
before `listen()` resolves.

`useWindowLayoutMode` uses renderer width as a browser-preview/fake-test
fallback, but accepts only a validated native `layout-mode-changed` work-area
event when the desktop host provides one. Keep its resize debounce, event
validation, and cleanup with the layout policy rather than duplicating the
normal/constrained decision in a component.

```tsx
// Pattern from src/hooks/useTauriEvent.ts
useEffect(() => {
  let disposed = false;
  let unlisten: UnlistenFn | undefined;
  // await listen(...), then retain or immediately call the unlisten function
  return () => {
    disposed = true;
    unlisten?.();
  };
}, [eventName]);
```

## Stateful Hook Shape

Hooks keep feature-specific transient state and expose named values plus
handlers. `useApiKeyState` returns `apiKey`, `setApiKey`,
`handleApiKeyChange`, and `showApiKey`; it synchronizes a form field with an
editable JSON configuration while retaining the feature's validation rules.
Use a named return object when a hook exposes multiple related values.

Resource hooks that use TanStack Query retain their query key and invalidation
logic with the owning domain. For example, `useOpenClaw.ts` groups its hooks
and shared keys together instead of scattering key literals across components.

## Evidence

- [src/hooks/useDebouncedValue.ts](../../../src/hooks/useDebouncedValue.ts)
  shows a generic hook with an effect cleanup.
- [src/hooks/useTauriEvent.ts](../../../src/hooks/useTauriEvent.ts) handles
  asynchronous native subscription setup and teardown.
- [src/components/providers/forms/hooks/useApiKeyState.ts](../../../src/components/providers/forms/hooks/useApiKeyState.ts)
  demonstrates a co-located form-state hook with typed inputs and a named
  return object.
- [src/lib/layout/useWindowLayoutMode.ts](../../../src/lib/layout/useWindowLayoutMode.ts)
  shows a policy-adjacent hook with native-event authority and a safe fallback.
